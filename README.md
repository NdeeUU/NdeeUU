- 👋 Hi, I’m @NdeeUU. Like Scots, it's better to sound it out
- 👀 I’m interested in design but have my limitations so appreciate the support
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what I'm doing here. Joking when I probably shouldn't. Trying to be better at user-centred design
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. If you want to reach out I'm always happy to help others as they've helped me.
- 📫 How to reach me. Either here or on Linkedin
- 😄 Pronouns: Been called worse things but it'd be interesting if someone started abuse at the start of a conversation.
- ⚡ Fun fact: A classic that I have used for a long time is that I used to learn to play the chanter in a Hoover factory. To cut to the chase I did not last long so please don't ask me to play the chanter or the pipes.
